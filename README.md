# Direct3DCompute
This repository contains Delphi example on how to initialize and draw a triangle using Direct3D 11 in Delphi 
without any external dependencies. This example has been created with Delphi Tokyo 10.2.3, but should be 
fairly compatible with earlier versions.

To compile shaders, execute "compile.bat" in the appropriat sub-folder. Note that this requires "fxc.exe" to 
be within system environment path. This can be acomplished by installing Windows SDK and then searching for
that file and then adding it to path.
